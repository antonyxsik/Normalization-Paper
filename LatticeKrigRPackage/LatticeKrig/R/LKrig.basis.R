    # It should be equivalent to just transforming the locations outside of LatticeKrig.
    # Where ever the observation locations are used

    # determine the grid centers.

    # in the transformed scale and so a  transformation is not needed.

    # and V set to diag( c(1,1) ) one would get the same results.
