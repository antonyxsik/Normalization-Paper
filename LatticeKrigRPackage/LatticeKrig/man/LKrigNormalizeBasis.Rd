\title{Methods and functions to support normalizing to 
	marginal variance of one. 

}
\description{The basis functions can be normalized so that the 
	marginal variance of the process at each level and at all locations is
	one. A generic function \code{LKrigNormalizeBasis} computes this for
	any LatticeKrig model. However, in special cases the normalization can 
	be accelerated. \code{LKrigNormalizeBasisFast} takes advantage of rectangular geometry and a constant \code{a.wght}, and further decomposes the SAR matrix using Kronecker products. This method calculates the exact marginal variance while providing an increase in computational efficiency. The \code{LKrigNormalizeBasisFFTInterpolate} method is the fastest, yet it provides an approximate marginal variance, and can only be used when there are significantly less basis functions than locations.

\arguments{
  \item{a.wght}{A.wght parameters.}
  \item{LKinfo}{ An LKinfo object.  NOTE:  Here  \code{choleskyMemory}, a Spam memory argument, can be a component of LKinfo and is subsequently passed
  	 through to the	(spam) sparse cholesky decomposition}
  \item{Level}{The multi-resolution level.}
  \item{mx}{Matrix of lattice sizes.}
  \item{PHI}{Unnormalized basis functions evaluated at the locations 
  	to find the normalization weights.}
  \item{x}{Locations to find normalization weights.}
  \item{\dots}{Additional arguments for method. }
}
\details{
Normalization to unit variance is useful for reducing the artifacts of
the lattice points and creates a model that is closer to being stationary. 
The computation must be done for every point evaluated with the basis functions 
The basic calculation is 
\preformatted{
	tempB <- LKrigSAR(LKinfo, Level = Level)
    tempB <- LKrig.spind2spam(tempB)
    wght <- LKrig.quadraticform(t(tempB) %*% tempB, PHI = PHI, 
        choleskyMemory = choleskyMemory)
}
This generic method uses the low level utility \code{LKrig.quadraticform} that evaluates  diag( t(PHI) solve( Q.l) PHI ) where PHI are the basis functions evaluated at the locations and Q.l is the precision matrix for the lattice coefficients at level l. 
 

For constant a.wght and for the rectangular geometry one can use an eigen decomposition of the Kronecker product of the SAR matrix. This allows for a faster way of calculating the exact marginal variance. 

In cases where (2 * NC - 1) < s, where NC is the selected number of basis functions and s is the larger side of a 2-dimensional dataset, an approximate marginal variance with extremely high accuracy (average error 0.001\%, maximum error ~2\%) can be calculated. This is done by first calculating the marginal variance on a coarser grid, then performing 2-dimensional Fourier Interpolation to upsample to all locations of the dataset.

\value{
A vector of weights. The basis are normalized by dividing by the square root
of the weights.
